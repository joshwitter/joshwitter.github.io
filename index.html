	<p> I’m an applied economist and data scientist at Amazon, where I build large-scale econometric models to evaluate programs that impact worker health, safety, and retention. Previously, I led causal analyses, field experiments, and qualitative research for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I've also taught undergraduate economics at BYU and Texas A&M and volunteer as a math and statistics tutor. </p>
