	<p>I am a Causal Inference Researcher with a Ph.D. in Economics from Texas A&M University. My academic research interests include the labor supply and health effects of government programs and policies that affect low-wage workers. While these are the topics I have most experience with. I enjoy uncovering the causal effects of nearly any program, product, or policy change in government, business, or research.  </p>
