	<p>I am a Ph.D. Economist. At Amazon.com LLC, I use econometrics, data science, and machine learning to evaluate programs affecting worker health, safety, and retention. Before Amazon, I worked at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints where I ran econometric analyses for causal evaluation, planned and deployed field experiments, and conducted qualitatitve interviews. I've taught undergraduate economics courses at both BYU and Texas A&M and actively volunteer as a math and statistics tutor in my community. </p>
