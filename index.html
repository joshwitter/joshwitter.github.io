	<p> I currently work at Amazon.com LLC, where I apply econometrics and data science to build and deploy large-scale models that evaluate programs impacting worker health, safety, and retention. Previously, I worked for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, conducting causal econometric analyses, designing and running field experiments, and leading qualitative research efforts. I have taught undergraduate economics courses at both BYU and Texas A&M, and I actively volunteer as a math and statistics tutor in my community. </p>
