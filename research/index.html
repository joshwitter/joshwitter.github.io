  <li style="padding: 0 0 1em 0"> The Earned Income Tax Credit, a program designed to aid low-income households, and encourage work, lifts millions of families out of poverty every year. Given its' pro-work incentives, there has been droves of research analyzing the magnitude of employment effects, most of which has been focused around households with children. I focus on employment effects for an understudied population, childless adults, who have recently been the center of EITC expansion policy discussions. I use a difference-in-differences (DD) framework with Current Population Survey data to estimate the impact of expanding state EITCs on the employment of childless adults. Expanding state EITCs has led to significant increases in employment for childless women and small insignificant effects for childless men. A closer examination uncovers meaningful differences between men and women in the characteristics of marginal workers that future EITC expansions should take into account. </li>

    Derek Monson) </b></li>
  <li> Past research suggests that only 1 percent of children born to unmarried teenage mothers are
  placed for adoption. This low rate of adoption placement is surprising given the large possible
  economic consequences of teenage childbearing. We document the economic consequences on
  the four groups of people most directly affected by the decision to place the child for adoption:
  the mother, the child, the future children of the mother, and the grandparents of the child. We
  find that, on average, the combined lifetime economic benefit to these four groups from the
  decision to place a child for adoption is well over a million dollars. While the decision to place a
  child for adoption involves consideration of multiple social, family, and child factors, the results
  in this paper suggest that policies that produce even a small increase in the fraction of unmarried
    teenage mothers placing their child for adoption could produce very large social returns. </li>
