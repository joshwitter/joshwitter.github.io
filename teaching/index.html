<h2> Select Quotes from Student Evaluations </h3>
 <ul style="line-height:1.4;">
    <li> "I would take another course with this professor because he cares about his students because he remembers
  being an undergraduate and knows how difficult it can be at times." </li>
	    
    <li> "Always had extra office hours and would reply promptly to emails!" </li>
	    
    <li> "The exams were a fair representation of the materials" </li>
	    
    <li> "Professor Witter was always on time for our 8am class, He also provided weekly office hours and homework help
sessions." </li>
	    
    <li> "He is a very good teacher for economics and I would take him again if presented the chance to. The material is
difficult but he does a great job of explaining and walking you through it." </li>
	    
     <li> "Professor Witter was always prepared for class and did an excellent job at getting through the material. I loved the
"research breaks" where he would bring up a case from the real world to apply course concepts. I ended up using the
research breaks in my other classes! The additional assignments he assigned were also super interesting and exposed
us to more cases about economics applied in real-world situations. Professor Witter has been my favorite economics
	     professor so far!" </li>
	    
     <li> "I thought he was a very effective teacher, I wish I had him for earlier econ classes, I left this class feeling like I really
	had an understanding of the material" </li>

     <li> "Great professor, genuinely cares about his students and their success." </li>    
    </ul>
